# Happy Cooking Webpage

Third Milestone Project: Data Centric Development - Code Institute

My Happy Cooking Webpage is an interactive webpage, which main purpose is to explore the world through a variety of recipes and to be able to allow the user to discover their passion about cooking. In addition it allows the user to manipulate the data and the recipes, by either crreating, reading, updating and deleting the recipes(CRUD)
## UX

My main purpose when creating the webpage was to ensure that it covers a wide range of recipes from all over the world that can be easily accessed and manipulated.

- As a user of the webpage I want to be able to view all the recipes that the owner of the webpage has provided by clicking a button in the home page.
- As a user I want to specify my search criteria and be able to get results for recipes that fit for vegans and vegeterians.
- As a user of the webpage I want to specify my search criteria and be able to get results for recipes from particular countries.
- As a user of the webpage I want to be able to search for specific recipes by category.(Appetisers, Starters, Main Courses, Desserts).
- As a user of the webpage I want to be able to insert my own recipes and save them to the webpage.
- As a user of the webpage I want to be able to edit the recipes that exist in the webpage by clicking a button and be able to save the updated recipes.
- As a user of the webpage I want to be able to delete the recipes that I do not like.
- As a user of the webpage I want to be able to see all the different categories of the recipes.
- As a user of the webpage I would also like to be able to create, read, update and delete the categories of the recipes.
- As a user of the webpage I want the webpage to have an easy access navigation bar that is clear for the purpose of each section.
- As a user I want to access the webpage from all differend types of divices (MObile Phones, Desktops,Laptops, Tablets, etc.)
- As a user of the webpage I want to be able to insert an image in when inserting or updating a recipe.
